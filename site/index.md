**Origin story**

Nowhere Lab was started in 2020 as an online lab community. When Priya moved from a traditional lab-based postdoc to two alt-ac (alternative academia) roles, [they missed having a lab community, and thought others might feel the same](https://x.com/priyasilverst/status/1338923077988732930). Nowhere Lab now has over 200 members, so clearly others did!

Our name is inspired by the Beatles song [_Nowhere Man_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8scSwaKbE64). From the film [_Yellow Submarine_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Submarine_(film)), the song refers to the character Jeremy Hillary Boob, PhD. a self-described _"eminent physicist, polyglot classicist, prize-winning botanist, hard-biting satirist, talented pianist, good dentist too"_. Reviewing his own works, he states _"it's (his own) policy to never read them"_. Jeremy is always busy with multiple projects: _“so little time, so much to know”_!

**Weekly meetings**

We hold weekly meetings that change time every 3 months to attempt to accommodate members in different time zones. Oct-Dec 2024 meetings are held every Friday at 3.30-4.30pm (UK) and last approximately 1 hour but are sometimes slightly longer (you're welcome to leave whenever you need to). You can check out our [calendar](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iuvYmKm3uU4wT-Rd8FmtJPW9Bf18wmXOqz7n2dikPps/edit) here to see what we’re up to each week!

**Slack channel**

We have a Slack channel which is the base for our community -- somewhere members can interact even if they're unable to attend meetings. Here we share resources, memes, support, and more.
