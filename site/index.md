**Origin story**

Nowhere Lab was started in 2020 as an online lab community. When Priya moved from a traditional lab-based postdoc to two alt-ac (alternative academia) roles, [they missed having a lab community, and thought others might feel the same](https://x.com/priyasilverst/status/1338923077988732930). Nowhere Lab now has over 200 members, so clearly others did!

Our name is inspired by the Beatles song [_Nowhere Man_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8scSwaKbE64). From the film [_Yellow Submarine_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Submarine_(film)), the song refers to the character Jeremy Hillary Boob, PhD. a self-described _"eminent physicist, polyglot classicist, prize-winning botanist, hard-biting satirist, talented pianist, good dentist too"_. Reviewing his own works, he states _"it's (his own) policy to never read them"_. Jeremy is always busy with multiple projects: _“so little time, so much to know”_!

**Weekly meetings**

We hold weekly meetings that change time every 3 months to attempt to accommodate members in different time zones. From November 2025 onwards, meetings are held TUESDAYS at 9am (UK) and THURSDAYS at 4pm (UK) and will be catch-up and co-work only, lasting approximately 1 hour. 

**Slack channel**

We have a Slack channel which is the base for our community -- somewhere members can interact even if they're unable to attend meetings. Here we share resources, memes, support, and more.
