We are Nowhere Lab. Anyone from any field is welcome to join who doesn't have a lab but would like the lab meeting experience. Target audience includes but is absolutely not limited to:
- New faculty who have no one in their lab yet
- Ex-academics who now work in industry
- Freelance sci-commers/consultants
- People who are in a toxic lab
- People between jobs
- Keen undergrads

**To join, email priyasilverstein at gmail.com*

**Weekly meetings**

We hold weekly meetings that change time every 3 months to attempt to accommodate members in different time zones. January-March meetings are held every Friday at 1:30 pm GMT and last approximately 1 hour but are sometimes slightly longer (you're welcome to leave whenever you need to).

**Slack channel**

We have a Slack channel which is the base for our community -- somewhere members can interact even if they're unable to attend meetings. Here we share resources, memes, support, and more.

**How to contribute to this website**

Anyone can contribute, just click 'Github', fork the repository, make changes, and make a pull request. 

Feel free to add blog-style posts under 'Posts', e.g. your Nowhere Lab origin story, a tutorial on something you've learned and want to share, pictures you've collated of your plants -- anything!
